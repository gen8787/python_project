Python Project

App Ideas:

1. Use mountainproject.com API to find rock climbs a user wants to complete. View other users with the same ‘To-do List’. Maybe display those climbs on an integrated map using GPS coordinates from API. If a person does not have a MP account, maybe have the API search for climbs near the user.

2. Import in a GPS file and have the app calculate the hike time depending on length, steepness, and user-defined fitness level. Have an integrated map and allow users to draw the track right in the app. This seems like a more advanced project and could be better for a future project.


Mountain Project API App

Goals:
1. Get more familiar with using API’s.
2. Incorporate maps and GPS type data.
3. Produce a visually appealing app.

Technologies used:
1. https://leafletjs.com
2. https://www.mapbox.com



List of functionalities:

- Login / Registration Page - redirects to main app page
- Main app page:
- Form input for Mountain Project username/email to fetch API data
- Display other users in with their number of todos and a link to their page
- Users page displays in depth info about their todo list, and maybe a map
- Be able to add other users’ todos to your own todo list - though this may have to be done through MP.com.
